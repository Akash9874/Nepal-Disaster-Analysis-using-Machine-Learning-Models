# Nepal-Disaster-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-Models

The script is a comprehensive implementation of loss detection and analysis using a dataset of disaster incidents in Nepal. Here's an overview of the key steps in the code:

1.Data Import and Preprocessing

Libraries: Uses libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels for data handling, visualization, and statistical analysis.

Dataset Import: The dataset is read from a CSV file containing details of various disasters./n

Preprocessing:
Drops unnecessary columns (e.g., S.No., Remarks).
Removes rows with missing values in important columns (Estimated Loss, District).
Converts certain numerical columns to their absolute values (e.g., Injured, Affected Family).
